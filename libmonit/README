libmonit:


This library synthesis modules used by Monit into a static library. This
factoring of functionality into a separate library represent the first step in
our process of refactoring and improving Monit.

What you see here now is only a small subset of the actual library and just
the bare minimum for what is necessary to implement 'check program'.

The long-term goal is to reduce the source code of Monit to basically a parser
for the configuration language and a validator which will run the different
checks. The rest of the code will be replaced with new libmonit code.

Libmonit is built as part of Monit and is not meant to be installed nor
distributed. The build system will link libmonit into the monit binary as a
static library. PLEASE DO NOT USE OR DISTRIBUTE LIBMONIT AS A SEPARATE
LIBRARY.
